•	This project focuses on enhancing network security by employing advanced log-based analysis techniques. It safeguards the system from various cyber threats, including DDoS attacks, SQL injections, and brute force attacks.
•	Automatically processes vast amounts of user logs generated on Cloud Servers. The system efficiently categorizes these logs into attack files and user-specific logs.
•	It enables real-time monitoring and analysis, allowing for prompt response to any suspicious activities. This automated approach ensures that potential threats are identified and addressed promptly, minimizing the risk of security breaches.
•	One of the standout features of this project is its proactive approach to security.
•	In the event of an unauthorized user attempting to inject malicious data or launch an attack on the Cloud Server, the system responds instantly. 
•	By automatically detecting such activities, the system takes immediate action to block the attacker's IP address, preventing further unauthorized access and safeguarding the server from potential damage.
•	This proactive security measure significantly enhances the overall resilience of the network infrastructure, ensuring a secure environment for users and their data.
