<h3.This project focuses on enhancing network security by employing advanced log-based analysis techniques. It safeguards the system from various cyber threats, including DDoS attacks, SQL injections, and brute force attacks.<h3/>
<h3>Automatically processes vast amounts of user logs generated on Cloud Servers. The system efficiently categorizes these logs into attack files and user-specific logs.<h3/>
<h3>It enables real-time monitoring and analysis, allowing for prompt response to any suspicious activities. This automated approach ensures that potential threats are identified and addressed promptly, minimizing the risk of security breaches.<h3/>
<h3>One of the standout features of this project is its proactive approach to security.</h3>
<h3>In the event of an unauthorized user attempting to inject malicious data or launch an attack on the Cloud Server, the system responds instantly. </h3>
<h3>By automatically detecting such activities, the system takes immediate action to block the attacker's IP address, preventing further unauthorized access and safeguarding the server from potential damage.</h3>
<h3>This proactive security measure significantly enhances the overall resilience of the network infrastructure, ensuring a secure environment for users and their data.</h3>
